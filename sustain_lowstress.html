    <h2>Low Stress Handling</h2>
    <p><strong>A Foundation of Sustainable Cattle Farming</strong></p>
    <p>
      At Skyfall Angus, sustainability begins with behaviour, welfare, and respect. Low stress handling isn’t just a technique — it’s a philosophy that shapes how cattle move, think, and thrive. Calm cattle are healthier, safer, and more productive, creating a more resilient farm system for the long term.

      <h3>Animal Welfare That Builds Long‑Term Resilience</h3>
      <p>Low stress handling reduces fear, injury, and physical strain. By working with natural cattle behaviour rather than against it, Skyfall Angus supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Better welfare outcomes</li>
        <li>Lower stress during yarding, transport, and routine handling</li>
        <li>Stronger immune function and overall herd health</li>
        <li>Calmer calves raised by calmer mothers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This approach strengthens the herd across generations.</p>

      <h3>Calm Cattle, Better Performance</h3>
      <p>Research and producer experience show that cattle handled calmly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain weight better during transport</li>
        <li>Move more easily through yards and laneways</li>
        <li>Experience fewer injuries</li>
        <li>Deliver more consistent performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For Skyfall Angus, this means healthier animals, improved productivity, and a more efficient operation.</p>

      <h3>Infrastructure and Design That Support Natural Movement</h3>
      <p>
        Sustainable handling is supported by thoughtful infrastructure. Skyfall Angus uses paddock flow, laneways, and yard design that encourage cattle to move naturally with minimal pressure. This reduces stress, improves safety for handlers, and protects the environment by preventing unnecessary disturbance and over‑movement across paddocks.
