      <p>Skyfall Angus operates across three distinct properties, each offering unique advantages to our herd and breeding program. Our original site in Razorback provides lush pastures and a temperate climate, ideal for nurturing young stock and supporting year‑round grazing. The second location, Camden, boasts fertile soils and reliable rainfall, enabling us to focus on genetic advancement and herd expansion in optimal conditions.</p>

      <p>In 2023, we added a third property in Goulburn, where the varied climate and diverse pasture types have proven particularly beneficial for our older female herd. This strategic spread across multiple locations allows us to adapt to seasonal changes, manage stock efficiently, and maintain the highest standards of animal welfare and productivity. Each property reflects our commitment to responsible stewardship and sustainable farming practices, ensuring the Skyfall herd thrives in Australian conditions.</p>
