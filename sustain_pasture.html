    <h3>Strength in the herd, resilience in the soil</h3>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->

        <h3>Maintain Soil Health & Fertility</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy soil is the backbone of a productive grazing system. At Skyfall Angus, we prioritise practices that build long‑term soil resilience, including minimising soil disturbance through reduced or no‑till methods, and adding organic amendments such as manure or compost. Healthy soil improves water filtration, carbon storage, and plant growth — all essential for sustainable pasture performance.

      <div class="pasture-text">
        <h3>Promote Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services</h3>
        <p>
          Diverse pastures are naturally more resilient to drought, pests, and climate variability. Our approach includes planting mixed species such as grasses and legumes, maintaining habitat corridors for wildlife, and reducing chemical inputs to support natural nutrient cycling and pollinators. Biodiversity strengthens the entire farm ecosystem.

      <div class="pasture-text">
        <h3>Optimise Grazing Management</h3>
        <p>
          Grazing pressure is one of the most powerful levers in pasture management. We use rotational grazing to divide paddocks and allow rest periods, preventing overgrazing and promoting regrowth. We also spell pastures to let them set seed and recover, while monitoring animal health and adjusting stocking rates as needed. Rotational systems are essentially governance frameworks for grass — and they work.

      <div class="pasture-text">
        <h3>Build Long‑Term Pasture Resilience</h3>
        <p>
          Long‑term resilience comes from balancing soil health, biodiversity, grazing pressure, and seasonal planning. By integrating these principles, Skyfall Angus ensures our pastures remain productive, adaptable, and environmentally responsible — supporting both our herd and the landscape for generations to come.
