    <h2>Water Use</h2>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <div class="water-section">

      <div class="water-text">
        <h3>Capture & Store Rainfall</h3>
        <p>
          Capturing rainfall is one of the most effective ways to secure water for the future. Well‑designed storage systems help reduce reliance on external or groundwater sources, improve drought preparedness, lower long‑term operating costs, and minimise runoff and erosion. From tanks to strategically placed farm dams, efficient storage is the backbone of a resilient water system.

      <div class="water-text">
        <h3>Use Water‑Efficient Irrigation</h3>
        <p>
          Modern irrigation systems — especially drip irrigation — deliver water directly to plant roots, reducing waste and improving crop performance. Benefits include lower evaporation losses, reduced runoff, precise nutrient delivery, and improved water‑use efficiency across the farm. This approach is especially valuable in water‑limited regions.

    <div class="water-section">

      <div class="water-text">
        <h3>Design the Landscape to Hold Water</h3>
        <p>
          Good land design helps slow, spread, and sink water into the soil. Techniques such as contour banks, swales, riparian buffers, and vegetation strips reduce erosion, improve infiltration, and protect waterways. These features strengthen the landscape’s natural ability to retain moisture.

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <div class="water-section reverse">
      <img src="images/img_wateruse_4.jpg" alt="Soil Water Retention">
      <div class="water-text">
        <h3>Build Soil That Holds More Water</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy soil acts like a sponge. Practices that improve soil structure — including cover cropping, conservation tillage, organic amendments, and rotational grazing — increase water retention. Better soil means more moisture available for plants, even in dry periods.
        </p>

    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <div class="water-section">

      <div class="water-text">
        <h3>Monitor Water Use & Quality</h3>
        <p>
          Sustainable water management includes regular monitoring of salinity, pH, turbidity, mineral content, and storage levels. Clean, reliable water supports livestock health, pasture growth, and overall farm performance.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 6 -->
    <div class="water-section reverse">
      <img src="images/img_wateruse_6.jpg" alt="Drought Planning">
      <div class="water-text">
        <h3>Plan for Drought</h3>
        <p>
          A strong drought plan includes assessing stock and domestic water needs, ensuring adequate storage capacity, reticulating water to key areas, and building redundancy into the system. Proactive planning reduces the impact of dry seasons on livestock, pastures, and natural assets.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 7 -->
    <div class="water-section">
      <img src="images/img_wateruse_6.jpg" alt="Protecting Water Sources">
      <div class="water-text">
        <h3>Protect Water Sources</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy catchments produce cleaner, more reliable water. Key practices include fencing off dams and waterways, managing erosion, maintaining vegetation around water sources, and preventing contamination from livestock access. These steps support both productivity and environmental health.
